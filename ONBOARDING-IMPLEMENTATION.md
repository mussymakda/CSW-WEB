### Onboarding Flow for Flutter App

1. **Login Attempt** → User enters email/password → If first login detected, redirect to onboarding
2. **Send OTP** → User requests OTP → System sends 6-digit code to email
3. **Verify OTP** → User enters OTP and new password → System verifies and returns auth token
4. **Accept Terms** → User accepts terms and conditions → Status updated
5. **Profile Form** → User fills optional profile information → Data saved
6. **Goal Selection** → User selects multiple fitness goals → Goals associated
7. **Weight Input** → User enters current weight (optional) → Weight saved
8. **Height Input** → User enters current height (optional) → Height saved
9. **Completion** → System marks onboarding complete → User can access main app
